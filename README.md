Final project of Android Weather app
Project name : WeatherApp
An Android App where you can check weather from city you want and see forecast for next three days, it was built with mvvm architecture, dagger-hilt, livedata,coroutines, jetpack libraries. 
To get the data the Weather Api used and to realize this Retrofit2 was used.
For reducing the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in our project the dependency injection with Dagger Hilt was used.
Dagger Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically.
For saving data stored from Retrofit2 I used the Room database.
